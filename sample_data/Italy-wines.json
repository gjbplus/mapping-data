The name Messorio refers to the ancient Tuscan practice of wheat harvesting, the most important time of the year in the countryside; now, to Le Macchiole, it is all about grape harvesting. A generous grape variety, perfect for the typical Bolgherese wine blends, but tricky and difficult when made into a single varietal wine. Currently considered to be one of Italy\u2019s most representative Merlot-based wines, Messorio is very complex and elegant and evolves beautifully in the bottle year by year."
