Peach, Asian pear, honeysuckle and plum on the nose are accented by subtle notes of hazelnut, brioche and tarragon. The palate is energetic and fresh with citrus and spice at mid-palate leading way to a long, citrus and mineral finish.

    "notes": "Our Sonoma Chardonnay comes from some of the oldest Dutton Ranch plantings in Russian River. These vines consistently yield fruit of great complexity and intensity seldom found in other sites. Cooler temperatures toward the end of the 2008 growing season resulted in crisp, well-defined flavors and long ripening times. Ripe citrus, Tupelo honey and sweet floral notes combined with seductive oak and all-spice aromas are just the beginning. Sun-ripened citrus fruit flavors are framed with brilliant acidity giving this wine its trademark zest and tremendous length."
